Using Logistic regression to classify between Malignant and Benign tumors on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.  <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29">Breast Cancer Diagnostic data</a> is available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.


Why is addressing Breast cancer so important ?


Worldwide, breast cancer is the leading type of cancer in women, accounting for 25% of all cases. In 2018 it resulted in 2 million new cases and 627,000 deaths. It is more common in developed countries and is more than 100 times more common in women than in men. In India, this disease is classified as common with over 10 Lakh cases per year. 


Conclusions : 
From the Exploratory Data Analysis, a few characteristics of the data are abundantly clear : 
1. Many parameters correlate deeply. 
2. An interesting find was regarding 'Fractal Dimension'. 'Fractal Dimension' has been considered as a sign of progression of Breast cancer and therefore, an important feature in the  diagnosis of cancer. However, data exploration and visualization suggests that it is not deeply correlated with other features. A research paper published by NCBI suggests alongs the same lines that the Medical acceptance of Fractal Dimension as a feature remains inconclusive. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6349609/). 
3. Smoothness and Symmetry did not turn out to be a key feature and have less correlation with KPIs.
